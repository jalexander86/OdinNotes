Command Line Basics
**Describe what the command line is
**Open the command line on your computer
**Use the command line to navigate directories and display contents
**Use the command line to create a new directory and new file
**Use the command line to rename or destroy a directory and a file
**Use the command line to open a file or folder in a program

CTRL + ALT + T - opens the Terminal
$ whoami - shows username
$ touch - creates a new file
    ex: touch index.html script.js style.css
$ pwd - present working directory. Shows path of current directory
$ pwd -P - shows physical path with all symlinks resolved

List Files & Directories (ls)
$ ls - lists files and directories in pwd
$ ls /usr/local/ - you can see what is in another directory without leaving
    your current directory
$ ls - a - shows all files, including hidden files (.file or .folder)
$ ls -l - shows long-form version of files/folders w more details
$ ls -lh - shows human readable sizes for files/folders (-h)
$ ls -lhs - sorts files/folders by size, from largest to smallest (-s)
$ ls -lt - sorts files/folders by last modified time (-t)
$ ls -ltr - reverses the sort (-r)

Links (ln)
$ ln a.txt b.txt - makes a hard copy of file a (file b) which will 
    automatically update as a is edited/saved
    You can only create a hard link within the same directory
$ ln a.txt b.txt -f - (-f) forces a link when source file already exists
$ln -s a.txt b.txt - creates a symbolic link for file or folder. 
    Symbolic links can be used for linking to other directories

Change Directories (cd)
$ cd ~/Documents - changes the directory to a new folder
$ cd .. - move back up a directory
$ cd - move back to the home directory

Creating Directory (mkdir)
$ mkdir foo - creates a new folder/directory called 'foo'
$ mkdir -p a/b/c - creates nested (intermediate) directories a/b/c

Remove/Delete Directory (rmdir)
$ rmdir test - deletes a directory named "test"

Verbose Output (-v)
$ mkdir -v a - console will give status updates when u do something
     (eg: mkdir: created directory 'a')
     
Copying Files (cp)k
$ cp a.txt b.txt - makes a copy of file a (does not update automatically
      like a link) 
      If a folder/directory is used for target then original file name
      will be used in target folder/directory
$ cp a.txt b.txt foo - copies multiple files (directory must be target)
$ cp *.txt foo - copies all .txt files and creates them in foo directoy
$ -v - verbose output can verify what you are doing 
     (eg: cp -v a.txt b.txt
        verbose output:  a.txt -> b.txt)

Copying Directories (-R)
$ cp -R foo bar - allows you to copy a directory (not allowed by default)

Force Overwriting of a file (-f)
$ cp a.txt b.txt - may not work if files already exist
$ cp -f a.txt b.txt - forces the overwiting of existing files

Confirm Overwriting of a file (-i)
$ cp -i a.txt b.txt - a prompt asking if you want to override will show

Deleting files (rm)
$ rm -v a.txt - (rm) deletes files or folders

Moving Files (mv)
$ mv -v a.txt b.txt - moves files or folders



Input/Output (|,>)
$ ls -a ~ | grep _  - this uses the "pipe" operator "|" to list all
    files that contain an underscore "_".
    The output of the ls command is "piped" to the grep command

Writing to a File (>)
$ls -a ~ | grep _ > underscores.txt  - this lists all files (ls)
    then finds all with underscores (grep _) then writes that ouput 
    (the list of files) to a document called underscores.txt

Reading from a File (<)
  not sure how this is supposed to work
  However...
$ cat test.txt - will ouput the contents of test.txt in terminal


Copying & Pasting in Linux
   CTRL + SHIFT + C = copy
   CTRL + SHIFT + V = paste
   
Tab Completion
    TAB completes partially typed stuff
    ex: cd Dow + TAB fills in "Downloads" to change to that directory
    
Open everything in a project directory with .
    ex: cd into project directory then type "code ." 
     -this will open all project files in VSCode
 
Open files or folders in VSCode
    ex: "code my_awesome_project/ or code style.css"
    
xdg-open filename.txt = opens a txt file
