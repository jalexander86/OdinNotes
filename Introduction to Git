Introduction to Git

git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git = clone repository
git status = shows status of document
git add = adds document to queue
git -m commit = commit file to repository
git commit -m "Blah blah blah" = commits with comment
git log = view commit history
git push = pushes all committed files to repository (will show on github.com)

code . = opens all files in repository in Visual Studio Code
CTRL + S = Saves a file


Best Practice:
-atomic commits = only commit changes that are related to a specific feature
